# macOS Desktop Bookmark Creator
 Mimics the same ability when using Safari in iOS to save a webpage to the home screen (iOS) Desktop (macOS) so it can be launched like an application.  It also attempts to capture the primary favicon for the website and add it as the application wrapper.  Only tested on Apple Silicon M1 but imagine it will work on Intel too since I created it with Apple Script.
